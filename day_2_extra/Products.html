    <h2>Couch</h2>
    <p>
      A couch also known as a sofa, futon, chesterfield, or settee/sofa or couch
      is a piece of furniture for seating two or three people in the form of a
      bench, with armrests, which is partially or entirely upholstered, and
      often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.Although a couch is used
      primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping. In homes, couches are
      normally found in the family room, living room, den, or the lounge. They
      are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels,
      lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars.

    <h2>Television(T.V)</h2>
    <p>
      A television set or television receiver, more commonly called a
      television, TV, TV set, telly, or tele, is a device that combines a tuner,
      display, and loudspeakers, for the purpose of viewing and hearing
      television broadcasting through satellites or cables, or viewing and
      hearing a computer. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form,
      television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in
      electronic form, using cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. The addition of
      color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity
      of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common
      feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the
      display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax,
      VHS and later DVD. It has been used as a display device since the first
      generation of home computers and dedicated video game consoles in the
      1980s. By the early 2010s, flat-panel television incorporating
      liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, especially LED-backlit LCD
      technology, largely replaced CRT and other display technologies. Modern
      flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p,
      1080i, 1080p) and can also play content from a USB device.

    <h2>DVD</h2>
    <p>
      Stands for "Digital Versatile Disc." A DVD is a type of optical media used
      for storing digital data. It is the same size as a CD, but has a larger
      storage capacity. Some DVDs are formatted specifically for video playback,
      while others may contain different types of data, such as software
      programs and computer files.
